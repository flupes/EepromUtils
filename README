EepromUtils provides facilities to manage data on the Arduino EEPROM.

EepromUtils is a library of classes allowing an easy acces to the
permanent storage (EEPROM) of an AVR microprocessor on an Arduino Board.

The library provides the following functionalities:

- SafeEeprom allows serveral data types to be written to and read from
  EEPROM while providing boundary checks.

- EnduranceEeprom implement a circular buffer to minimize wear when
  writting repiteveliy data to the EEPROM

- EepromRingBuffer provides a ring buffer for arbitrary data types and
  uses EnduranceEeprom to minimize EEPROM wear due to the indexes
